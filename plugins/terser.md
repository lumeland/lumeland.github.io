description: Using the Terser plugin to minify javascript files
docs: plugins/terser.ts/~/Options

The Terser plugin minifies `.js` files using the
[Terser minifier](https://terser.org/). It **is disabled by default** so to
enable it you have to import and use it in the `_config.js` file:

```js
import terser from "lume/plugins/terser.ts";

site.use(terser());
```

To get around compatibility issues of using NodeJS software in Deno, it uses the
browser version.

It assumes that the files to be minified are modules, and so the `module`
option, as well as the `compress` and `mangle` options, are by default set to
`true`. You can override this by passing an options object with the Terser
options in an `options` object in the `use` function:

```js
import terser from "lume/plugins/terser.ts";

site.use(terser({
  options: {
    module: false,
  },
}));
```

Other minification options can also be set, but those relating to the filesystem
cannot. Minified files are given the same name as the input file in the same
directory structure. Note too that options apply to all files; you cannot use
different options for some files and not for others.

Source maps can be produced by passing `sourceMap: true` as a top-level option.
This will create a source map in the same directory as the file with `.map`
appended to the file name.

## The `terser` filter

In addition to the javascript loader and processor, this plugin register also
the `terser` filter so you can transform javascript code in the template
engines. For example:

```html
{% set js %}
  console.log("Hello, the JavaScript world!");
{% endset %}

<script type="module">
  {{- js | terser | safe -}}
</script>
```

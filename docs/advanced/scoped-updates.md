As you can see in [the order of operations](./order-of-operations.md) section,
after any change in the watch mode (with `lume --serve` or `lume --watch`), the
**entire site is built again**. This happens because it's almost impossible to
know in advance which pages will be affected by a change in any file. For
example:

- A change in a CSS file can affect to other CSS files that `@import` it (if you
  use [postcss plugin](../plugins/postcss.md)).
- If you also use the [inline plugin](../plugins/inline.md), that can insert the
  CSS code in the HTML, this change will affect to all HTML pages.

Lume is conservative about the updating process, to make sure that any change in
any file will be correctly applied to all pages. This is why the entire site is
rebuilt after any change.

In large sites, or sites with expensive processors (like bundlers) this can
increase the duration of the update process. There's a way to customize this
behavior using a feature named **Scoped Updates**. It's a way to define
different "scopes" (collections of independent files whose changes won't affect
to other pages).

For example, let's say that you're building a website that has some javascript
and css files, and these files are totally independent, meaning that:

- Changes in any CSS file only affects to other CSS files.
- Changes in any JS/TS file only affects to other JS/TS files.
- Changes in any other file (Nunjucks, Yaml, Markdown, etc) won't affect to CSS,
  JS or TS files.

In this case you create two scopes, one for CSS files and other for JS/TS files.
To do that, just add this code to your `_config.js` file:

```js
site.scopedUpdates(
  (path) => path.endsWith(".css"), //Select all *.css files
  (path) => /\.(js|ts)$/.test(path), //Select all *.js and *.ts files
);
```

Every function passed to this function will create a new scope. Now, if a `.css`
file changes, only the `.css` files are rebuilt, but not any other file. If a
`.js` or `.ts` file is updated, only these files are built. And if any other
file changes, all files are rebuilt except `.css`, `.ts` and `.js` files.

**Lume** is the Galician word for _fire_ but also a (yet another) static site
generator for [Deno](https://deno.land/).

It's inspired by other static site generators, such as
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), but it's
faster, simpler and easier to use and configure, besides being super flexible.

- Supports **multiple file formats**, like `markdown`, `yaml`, `javascript`,
  `typescript`, `jsx` and `nunjucks`, and it's easy to extend with more.
- You can hook **processors** to manipulate `html` and assets, like `css` or
  `js`.
- It's Deno: Forget about managing thousands of packages in `node_modules` or
  complex bundlers. **Lume** only installs what you need. Clean, fast and
  secure.

description: Add automatically a base path to all urls
---

The `base_path` plugin fixes all URLs in your HTML documents by prepending the
path of the [location setting](../getting-started/config-file.md#location). It's
useful if your site is hosted in a subdirectory and you don't want to use the
[`url` filter](../core/url.md) everywhere.

This plugin **is disabled by default** so to enable it you have to import and
use it in the `_config.js`. After that, any element with the attribute `href`,
`src`, `srcset` and `imagesrcset` will be automatically fixed.

```js
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import basePath from "lume/plugins/base_path.ts";

const site = lume({
  location: new URL("https://my-site.com/blog/"), // ‚Üê Note the path /blog/
});

site.use(basePath());
```

All **absolute** URLs of your site will be fixed. For example:

```html
<a href="/articles/my-second-article/">Go to the second article</a>
```

The `base_path` plugin will convert this HTML code to:

```html
<a href="/blog/articles/my-second-article/">Go to the second article</a>
```
